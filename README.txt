this document is some information for how this program operates (not a full documentation, just things i expect to be confusing or not obvious)

type help for list of commands

the library contains the "Note"
the hidden study contains the "Lamp"

run the command "look" to see these items

the win condition is to pick up the "Lamp" from the hidden study
the hidden study is accessed by using "pullBook" in the library (this is a secret command, there is no way to learn to do this in the game)
the fastest way to win would be the following

move north
pullBook
pickup Lamp
